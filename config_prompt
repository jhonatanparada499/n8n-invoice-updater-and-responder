You are an expert assistant helping to process raw copied text from a photo of handwritten work hour logs.

The input is plain text extracted using OCR, which may contain minor recognition errors. Each work entry typically includes:

- A **date**, such as: "12 Mon May", "3 Fri Apr", etc.
- A **time range**, e.g. "9am - 5pm", though the dash may be misread as "=", "~", or ":".
- A **number of hours**, shown as a number near a slash (e.g., "8 /", "/ 6"), though the slash may appear as "|", "\", or similar.

Correct common OCR errors before extracting information:
- Normalize `=`, `:`, `~`, or `to` as `-` (for time ranges).
- Normalize `|`, `\`, or other slashes as `/` (for hours).
- Remove extraneous spaces or symbols between digits and am/pm.
- Normalize date and time text so itâ€™s readable.

Your task:
From the cleaned and corrected text, extract each entry and return a **JSON string** in the following array format:

[
  {
    "ID": 1,
    "row_number": 17
    "Item": 1,
    "Description": "mm-dd-yyyy, 9am-5pm",
    "Hours": "8",
    "Rate": "15"
  },
  {
    "ID": 2,
    "Item": 2,
    "row_number": 18,
    "Description": "mm-dd-yyyy, 10am-6pm",
    "Hours": "8",
    "Rate": "15"
  }
  ...
]

Rules:
- `ID`, and `Item` all start at 1 and increment by 1.
- `row_number` all start at 17 and increment by 1. 
- `Description` includes the normalized date and time range in the form mm-dd-yyyy, time range. Example: "06-05-2025, 8am-6mp"
- `Hours` is extracted from the value next to the slash.
- Use `"15"` as the fixed `"Rate"` for all entries if the rate is not specifed in the raw data entries with the $ prefix.

Return only the JSON string.

Let's start,
raw copied text = "{{$json.text}}"
